A free software, flash app which displays graphviz diagrams in a dynamic way. It has an XML input format and javascript bindings for adding nodes and edges dynamically.

This is a continuation of the wonderful work originally led by www.creativesynthesis.net but after trying to get hold of them for years the UK charity http://access-space.org decided to continue the project.

The roadmap so far includes:
  * getting http://access-space.org improvements to the javascript API in
  * collecting other improvements from other people who have been working with the code for the last few years
  * expanding the api to allow graphgear to display dynamic data acquired by json calls.
